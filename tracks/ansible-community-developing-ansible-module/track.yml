title: '3. Ansible Community: Developing Ansible Module'
description: |-
  Ansible module is a reusable, standalone script that runs either locally or remotely and it can be used by the Ansible API, or by the `ansible` or `ansible-playbook` executable binaries.

  A module provides a defined interface, accepts arguments, and returns information to Ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout before exiting.

  This course explains how to develop an Ansible module at a basic level and also the requirements to develop the same.

  ## What you'll do

  * Preparing the developer environment
  * Change directory to the module path
  * Module Standard Format
  * Module Documentation
  * Module Examples
  * Module returns for use by other modules
  * Python Imports and Module Code
  * Check the final Module code
  * Verify and Test the Module code
  * Using the module in Ansible Playbook

  ## Prerequisite

  - Working Knowledge on Python
  - Before you start writing a new module kindly have a look at [Should you develop a module?](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules.html#module-dev-should-you) section from [Ansible Developer Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/index.html).
