title: '2. Ansible Community: Testing A Pull Request Locally'
description: |-
  In this course, weâ€™ll see how to check out a pull request locally to test new features and bug fixes that are submitted to the `Ansible Collection's` GitHub repositories.

  - Install Ansible package
  - Check out the source
  - Find a pull request and check it out on a branch
  - Test the changes from pull request locally

  If you get stuck, or something doesn't work, you can reach out to us by posting your comments on the GitHub discussion [here](https://github.com/ansible/instruqt/discussions/54).
