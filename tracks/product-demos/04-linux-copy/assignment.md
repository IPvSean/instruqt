    # Welcome to the Automate the Enterprise product demos!

    These demos show the power of the Ansible Automation platform for automating Linux, Windows, Networking, and Cloud all under one roof.

    Your lab will be ready soon. While you wait, click the arrow to the right to learn a little bit about the envrionment.

    </a>

    This lab contains an Ansible Controller, Red Hat Satellite, RHEL8 client, and Windows Server client. These will be added to the Workshop Inventory for you and a credential is created so that you can manage these hosts.

    # How Authentication Works

    The "Workshop Credential" contains the `ansible_password` (for windows) and ssh private key (for linux) to connect to your nodes. The username is defined for each host in the inventory with the `ansible_user` variable.

    Windows uses NTLM for authentication and the winrm connection variables are defined using `group_vars` in the project repo. Windows nodes _MUST_ be in `os_windows` group to properly configure the connection.

    # This Lab is for You!

    Shortly you will enter the lab environment and you'll find some instructions on the right hand side. These are merely suggestions to get you started. You do not have to follow them explicitly. Choose your own adventure and experiment to show, tell, learn, test, break, and fix. This lab is for you!

    Don't forget to submit comments or issues through the **FEEDBACK** job template and check us out on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/RedHatGov/product-demos) to be part of the community.

    Your lab is waiting...Happy Automating!

üëã Introduction
===
Before we get started a few things to know...
1) You do not have to follow this guide. Choose your own adventure!
2) Some things may require pre-reqs in other systems. Check the end of your **SETUP** job logs.
3) Please submit issues through the **FEEDBACK** job or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RedHatGov/product-demos/)
4) If you would like to customize, fork the [repo](https://github.com/RedHatGov/product-demos/) and update the project before you continue.

To get started, login to the Ansible Controller with the following credentials:

username: `admin`

password: `ansible123!`

Find detailed documentation and playbooks from this lab [here](https://github.com/RedHatGov/product-demos)

‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Setup Demos
===

Navigate to the Templates section and locate the **SETUP** template.

Click the üöÄ to run the Job Template and select a demo category from the drop down. This will create job templates, credentials, inventories for you.

While the Job runs, move to the next task.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - (optional) Explore the Inventory
===
While the **SETUP** job is running, click on the Inventories section.

Select the **Workshop Inventory** and click **Hosts**

You will see that there are 2 hosts added to the inventory. `node1` is your linux host, `win1` is your windows host.

Click on **Groups** and you will see there are 2 groups in the inventory. `os_linux` contains your `node1` linux host, `os_windows` contians your `win1` windows host.

When running Job Templates you will be prompted for the hosts to run against. Use `node1` or `win1` to target a single host or `os_linux` or `os_windows` to target a group of hosts.

Additional hosts or groups may become avaible if you use Dynamic Inventories.

By this point, the **SETUP** job should be complete. Click on **Jobs** to see your job history and verify.

You can click on the **SETUP** job to see the log of what changed or move to the next Task.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - (optional) Run Jobs
===
Navigate back to the Templates Section and you will see a series of Job Templates that have been created for you.

Locate the **LINUX / Fact Scan** job and click the üöÄ. Enter `os_linux` into the limit field and Launch. This will verify connectivity.

For Windows, locate the **WINDOWS / Run PowerShell** job and click the üöÄ. Enter `os_windows` into the limit field and Launch. This will verify connectivity.


‚òëÔ∏è Task 4 - (optional) Register RHEL to Red Hat Insights or Satellite
===

If you would like to register your linux host to Red Hat Insights, here's what you need...
1. Red Hat Subscription ([Organization ID](https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys))
2. [Activation Key](https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys). By default, the Activation key follows the format `RHEL<major version>_<env>`.

Edit the variables on the **LINUX / Register with Insights** job template to include your `org_id` and `activation_key`.

Run the job and enter `node1` into the survey to register to Insights.

While the job is running, go to the Credentials section and edit the **Insights Inventory Credential** with your username and password for [https://console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com). This will allow you to refresh the Insights dynamic inventory after your host is registered.

If you would like to register your linux host to Red Hat Satellite, here's what you need...

Run the job **LINUX / Register with Satellite** job templat

Run the job **LINUX / Register with Satellite** and enter `node1` into the survey and select the environment.
