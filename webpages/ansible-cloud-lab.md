# Introduction to cloud automation

This self-paced lab will demonstrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you orchestrate, operationalize and govern your hybrid cloud environments. This self-paced lab will primarily focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an example of a public cloud for several use-cases. Use-cases will include infrastructure visibility, compliance and Infrastructure optimization. Learn how Ansible can start helping you tame your hybrid cloud deployments today. This self-paced lab requires students to have beginner level knowledge of common public cloud terminology and limited to no knowledge of Ansible.

## Lab Agenda

Ansible Hybrid Cloud Automation Workshops

- [Infrastructure visibility](blah) - The goal of this lab is to illustrate how Ansible facts (key, value pairs) which is structured data we can retrieve from public clouds can provide us awareness of our cloud footprint easily and output it to anything.
- [Cloud Operations](blah) - The goal if these lab is to illustrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you automate common day-2 cloud operations tasks across cloud. Our focus here will be on public cloud (AWS), but the use cases here are ones you can extend across the hybrid cloud.
- [Infrastructure optimization](blah) - In this lab we will guide you in understanding some basic optimization exercises that can help you tame your public clouds.
