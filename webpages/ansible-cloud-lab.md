# Introduction to cloud automation

This self-paced lab will demonstrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you orchestrate, operationalize and govern your hybrid cloud environments. This self-paced lab will primarily focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an example of a public cloud for several use-cases. Use-cases will include infrastructure visibility, compliance and Infrastructure optimization. Learn how Ansible can start helping you tame your hybrid cloud deployments today. This self-paced lab requires students to have beginner level knowledge of common public cloud terminology and limited to no knowledge of Ansible.

## Lab Agenda

- [Infrastructure visibility](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/cloud-visibility?token=em_IYvE6P3BoPg-Fo50) - In this lab we will illustrate how we can retrieve Ansible facts (key, value pairs), also known as structured data, from public clouds and how we can use this data to provide us awareness of our cloud footprint easily
- [Cloud Operations](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/cloud-operations?token=em_785MP3rpLI7oAW1Y) - This lab will illustrate how Ansible Automation Platform can help you automate common day-2 cloud operations tasks across your public cloud. Our focus here will be on AWS, but the use cases here are ones you can extend across the hybrid cloud.
- [Infrastructure optimization](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/redhat/tracks/cloud-optimization?token=em_0h2ed0VTvBXyHNA6) - In this lab we will guide you in understanding some basic optimization exercises that can help you tame your public clouds.
